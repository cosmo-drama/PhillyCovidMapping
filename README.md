# PhillyCovidMapping

a project that aims to visualize philadelphia county covid case data, and analyze and find trends amongst zip codes. we are interested in questions like: 

which zip codes had the highest rates of covid? what are the tax rates in those areas? who predominantly resides in those areas? what is the median income of those areas?
